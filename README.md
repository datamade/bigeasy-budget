This is based on [Look at Cook](http://lookatcook.com) by Derek Eder and Nick Rougeux at [Open City](http://opencityapps.org), and can be easily re-deployed to visualize other budgets.

#### Dependencies

- [jQuery](http://jquery.com)
- [D3](http://d3js.org) (for CSV manipulation)
- [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) (javascript MVC framework)
- [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/) (charting library)
- [Datatables](http://datatables.net) (sortable HTML tables)

## How to Re-Deploy
This code can be customized to visualize another data set.
####Data Prepatation
The budget data can be in various forms (csv, google doc, google fusion table), but must adhere to a fixed format in order for the app to process it properly. Budget column headers include: Fund ID, Fund, Results Area ID, Results Area, Department ID, Department, Short Title, Link to Website, Department Description, and Control Officer. Values for appropriations and expenditures must be broken down into a separate column for each year.

See examples of prepped data:

  - [Cook County](https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?dsrcid=1227404)
  - [Macoupin County](https://github.com/datamade/macoupin-budget/blob/master/data/macoupin-budget_1997-2014.csv)
  - [A blank template to populate](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I6xZe8syHTiLguZ56l6J1KW0nAJVrUilvq0eP-BpE2A/edit?usp=sharing)

####Configuration
1. Once the data is prepared, set dataSource in js/app.js to link up to your data.
  
  *If your budget data is in CSV form:*
  Drop the csv file in the data folder, and set dataSource to the file path.
  
  *If your data is in a google doc:*
  You will first need to publish the google doc to the web as a CSV. Then, set dataSource to the URL provided.
